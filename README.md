# ATBInterviewAssignment

TThis project was built on Angular 7.3.5

## Server Start

1. Run `ng serve` to start the app in a dev environment.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Users

There are two users you can log in with:
1. tony-stark::password
2. steve-rogers::password

## Further notes

I did not add a node server or api calls to the current project. I did however, try my best to replicate server requests and reponses. You can see this in the serve files in src/app/shared/services.

Let me know if you have any questions! herambsawant11@gmail.com
